# Crystals-Collector-Game

Description

An interactive web browsers game that dynamically updates the HTML with the jQuery library.



How It Works

There are four crystals displayed on the page.

The player will be shown a target number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific value of each crystal to the player’s total score.

The game will hide this value until the player clicks a crystal.

When the player clicks a crystal, the app updates the player’s score counter.

The player wins if their total score matches the target number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the target number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
